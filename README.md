# Parameter-Identification-of-DC-Motors
Due to the increasing mass production of DC motors, procedures for inspecting them have been developed which are able to determine the test objects’ characteristic curves within seconds. Such procedures are known as Parameter Identification procedures.

# Short introduction
DC-motors are used in a wide variety of applications touching our daily lives, where they serve to relieve us of much work. However, the large number of DC-motors used is attended by a large amount of time and resources devoted to inspecting them at the end of their production cycle. The time needed for this process should be kept as brief as possible so that the inspection procedure is not the slowest part of the production process. Due to the increasing mass production of these motors, procedures for inspecting them have been developed which are able to deter-mine the test objects’ characteristic curves within seconds. Such procedures are known as Parameter Identification procedures. They determine the parameters without applying any external load, simply by measuring the current and voltage. The time and apparatus required for attaching a load and for aligning the test object with a loading mechanism can thus be totally omitted.
